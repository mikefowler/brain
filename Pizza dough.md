#recipes #recipes/keto #recipes/bread #recipes/dinner

*A recipe for pizza dough, originally based on Sweet as Honey's "[Coconut Flour Pizza Crust](https://www.sweetashoney.co/coconut-flour-pizza-crust-vegan-keto/#recipe-card)".*
## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

- ¼ cup [coconut flour](./Nutrition%20Facts.md#Anthony's%20Coconut%20Flour)
- ½ cup [almond flour](./Nutrition%20Facts.md#Anthony's%20Almond%20Flour)
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 3 tablespoons [ground psyllium husk](./Nutrition%20Facts.md#Anthony's%20Whole%20Psyllium%20Husk)
- 2 tablespoons [vital wheat gluten](./Nutrition%20Facts.md#Anthony's%20Vital%20Wheat%20Gluten)
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
### Wet Ingredients

- ¾ cup warm water
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 teaspoon inulin
- ¼ cup warm water (for activating the yeast)
## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 450° F
2. Activate the yeast by mixing it with the inulin and ¼ cup of warm water. Allow 5 to 10 minutes for the yeast to activate.
3. While waiting for the yeast, combine the dry ingredients (in the bowl of a stand mixer, for example) and mix to combine.
4. Now add wet ingredients, including the prepared yeast, to the bowl, and mix to combine. After about a minute, you should be able to use a spatula and your hands to form the dough into a ball.
5. Coat the ball in some olive oil, and leave it to rise for anywhere between 15 and 60 minutes.
6. Using a rolling pin and two pieces of parchment paper (one below, one on top), roll the dough into the shape you desire.
7. Pre-bake the crust, without any sauce or toppings, for about 12 minutes.
8. Remove from oven, top as desired, and return to the oven for 8 to 10 minutes.
